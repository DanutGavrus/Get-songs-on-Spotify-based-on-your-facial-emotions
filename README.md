## Get songs on Spotify based on your emotions
#### A short introduction
The music exploration field is pretty vast, but we need to take a look at the current existing solutions of exploration in order to see the benefits of the solution implemented by this project.
#### Current solutions
__YouTube Music__ and __Spotify__ offer personalized playlists such as the Discover Mix, New Release Mix, My Supermix on Youtube and the Discover Weekly, Release Radar, Daily Mixes on Spotify, but after that, there are not that many other __easy__ ways available for users.
#### My solution
My approach has a __more personal approach__ with the user because he receives new
songs based on how he's __feeling__ at the moment. This way, the bias in which one receives most of the new tracks similar or related to what he already likes is eliminated, thus being more beneficial for those who wants to really discover new music.

#### Want to try the app?
Sorry, but that is not easily possible right now ‚òπÔ∏è Why? Well:
- It is uploaded to Heroku, but it no longer supports free web apps.
- If I put the apk here, Android will tell you it is not safe, and I think that not many will install it. Adding it to PlayStore is unfortunately, also not free.
  
Overall, I think it's not worth paying right now as, maybe, not many will really play with it.  
__But__, if you want, I may do a live demo of the app anytime, just write me an email at: danut.gavrus@gmail.com.  
Also, you are free to explore the code here if you want.
