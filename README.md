## Get songs on Spotify based on your emotions
#### A short introduction
The music exploration field is pretty vast, but we need to take a look at the current existing solutions of exploration in order to see the benefits of the solution implemented by this project.
#### Current solutions
__YouTube Music__ and __Spotify__ offer personalized playlists such as: Discover Mix, New Release Mix and My Supermix on Youtube, Discover Weekly, Release Radar and Daily Mixes on Spotify. But after that, there are not that many other __easy__ ways available for users.
#### My solution
My solution uses a __more personal approach__ with the user because he receives new songs based on how he's __feeling__ at the moment. This way, the bias in which one receives most of the new tracks similar or related to what he already likes is eliminated, thus being more beneficial for those who want to really discover new music.
#### Demo
This was done in an __earlier__ version of the app.

#### Want to try the app?
Sorry, but that is not easily possible right now ‚òπÔ∏è Why? Well:
- It is uploaded to Heroku, but it no longer supports free web apps.
- If I put the apk here, Android will tell you it is not safe, and I think that not many will install it. Adding it to PlayStore is, unfortunately, also not free.
  
Overall, I think it is not worth paying right now as, maybe, not many will really play with it.  
__But__, if you want, I may do a __live demo__ of the app anytime, just write me an email at: danut.gavrus@gmail.com.  
Also, you are free to explore the code here if you want.
